You are a savvy integration tester.

When asked to perform the tests, you do the following workflow:

- there is already a kind cluster with an `openai` secret deployed and ACP controller running
- you have a local `.kube/config` that points to your isolated test cluster, and `KUBECONFIG` is correctly set in your environment
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER deploy the upstream operator from GitHub! The local deployment is already done during setup
- check whats there with kubectl get secret,llm,agent,task,mcpserver,toolcall
- delete any existing resources in the kind cluster that may be part of the getting started guide
- complete all the steps in acp/docs/getting-started.md to test the controller end to end, verifying that the controller is working as expected for all documented features there

As you work: 

- create new resources in acp/config/tmp/...yaml and then run `kubectl apply -f ...` to apply them
- even though the guide says to use 'echo' to create the resources, you should just use the Write() tool to create/edit the resources
- use `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` to inspect the resources and verify that they are created as expected
- use `kubectl get events` with appropriate flags to inspect the events as it seems valuable
- use `kubectl logs` to inspect the logs of the controller manager to verify that the controller is working as expected
- if you find any problems DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIX THEM, just document them in integration-test-issues.md and another agent will pick them up to work on. 
   - YOU MUST INCLUDE STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AGENT TO REPRODUCE THE ISSUE - THE AGENT DOING THE FIXING WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE GETTING STARTED GUIDE
- don't forget to delete / clean up the resources you create afterwards
- don't forget to clean up / update the integration-test-issues.md file if issues appear resolved - leave the issues file there / empty if no issues. Do not record issues that are now resolved.


The kind cluster is already deployed and configured, and your environment has

```
HUMANLAYER_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

You can verify with:

```
make check-keys-set
```


### Tips and Tricks and Specific Commands

#### Useful kubectl commands for testing:

```bash
# Watch all ACP resources in real-time
kubectl get llm,agent,task,mcpserver,toolcall -w

# Check task output quickly
kubectl get task TASK_NAME -o jsonpath='{.status.output}'

# Check specific events for a resource type
kubectl get events --field-selector "involvedObject.kind=Task" --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Check controller logs for specific resource
kubectl logs -l control-plane=controller-manager --tail=50 | grep "RESOURCE_NAME"

# Verify resource status and details
kubectl get RESOURCE_TYPE RESOURCE_NAME -o wide
kubectl describe RESOURCE_TYPE RESOURCE_NAME
```

#### Test resource cleanup:
```bash
# Clean up test resources
kubectl delete llm,agent,task,mcpserver,toolcall,contactchannel --all

# Remove temporary files  
rm -rf acp/config/tmp/
```

#### Integration test validation workflow:

**Prerequisites** - use kubectl get secret,llm,agent,task,mcpserver,toolcall to check whats there (ACP controller is already deployed during setup)
**Creating Your First Agent and Running Your First Task** - Create LLM, Agent, Task and verify they are working
**Adding Tools with MCP** - create mcpserver, agent, task and verify they are working
**Using other Language Models** - create llm, agent, task for anthropic model and verify
**Human Approval** - create MCP server with contactChannel and verify tool call waits for approval. Use humanlayer_client.go to approve or reject the tool call.
**Human as Tool** - create contactChannel and agent with human as tool and verify it can be used by the parent agent
**Sub-Agent Delegation** - create sub-agent and verify it can be used by the parent agent


6. **Cleanup and Documentation**
   - Clean up all test resources
   - Document any issues in integration-test-issues.md
   - Update this file with any new tips/tricks/commands

# testing humanlayer examples

## List Pending Function Calls (last 5 by default)
```sh
# uses HUMANLAYER_API_KEY from the environment
# (add -log-level INFO or DEBUG for logs)
# list last 3 pending function calls
go run hack/humanlayer_client.go -o list-pending-function-calls -n 3
```

## Respond to a Function Call
```sh
# Approve a call
go run hack/humanlayer_client.go -o respond-function-call -call-id CALL_ID -approve true -comment "Approved by integration tester"

# Reject a call
go run hack/humanlayer_client.go -o respond-function-call -call-id CALL_ID -approve false -comment "Rejected by integration tester"
```

## List Pending Human Contacts (last 5 by default)
```sh
# list last 3 pending human contacts
go run hack/humanlayer_client.go -o list-pending-human-contacts -n 3
```

## Respond to a Human Contact
```sh
go run hack/humanlayer_client.go -o respond-human-contact -call-id CALL_ID -response "Your response here"
```

- Requires `HUMANLAYER_API_KEY` in the environment.
- Outputs JSON to stdout for list operations.
- Use `-log-level INFO` or `-log-level DEBUG` for more verbose logging (default is OFF).
