# KinOS 10: Adaptive Context Management System
## Specification Document

### 1. System Overview

KinOS 10 is an advanced wrapper around Aider.chat that provides automated system prompt and file context management within an online hosted environment. The system enables LLMs to adapt to various tasks continuously while maintaining long-term context memory across sessions.

#### 1.1 Core Capabilities
- **Persistent Context Management**: Maintains conversation history and relevant context across sessions
- **Adaptive Mode Switching**: Dynamically switches between different operational modes based on user needs
- **File System Integration**: Organizes and manages kin-specific files in a structured manner
- **Long-Term Memory**: Stores and retrieves important information for future reference
- **Web Source Integration**: Gathers and incorporates information from external sources
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Handles text, code, and image inputs/outputs
- **API-Based Architecture**: Provides HTTP endpoints for seamless integration with frontends

#### 1.2 Target Use Cases
- Gaming companion
- Homework mentor
- Coding desktop assistant

### 2. System Architecture

#### 2.1 High-Level Components
1. **kin Manager**: Handles kin lifecycle and structure maintenance
2. **Context Builder**: Selects relevant files for context window construction
3. **Context Updater**: Modifies kin files based on conversation
4. **Response Generator**: Processes context and generates responses
5. **API Interface**: Provides endpoints for external systems

#### 2.2 Data Flow
1. Frontend sends request to API with kin identifier and message
2. kin Manager loads kin structure
3. Context Builder analyzes conversation and selects relevant files
4. Response Generator processes enhanced context and creates response
5. Context Updater modifies necessary files
6. Frontend polls for updates in messages.json

#### 2.3 blueprint Templates
KinOS supports multiple blueprint templates, each representing a specific use case (gaming companion, homework mentor, coding assistant, etc.). Each blueprint has a standardized template that defines the initial state of any new kin created for that blueprint.
1. Frontend sends request to API with kin identifier and message
2. kin Manager loads kin structure
3. Context Builder analyzes conversation and selects relevant files
4. Response Generator processes enhanced context and creates response
5. Context Updater modifies necessary files
6. Frontend polls for updates in messages.json

### 3. kin Structure

KinOS organizes kins in a blueprint-centric hierarchy:

```
/blueprints/
  /[blueprint_NAME]/     # e.g., duogaming, deskmate, kinos
    /template/          # Initial state for new kins
      kinos.txt
      system.txt
      map.json
      /modes/
      /adaptations/
      /memories/
      /sources/
      /images/
    /kins/
      /[kin_ID]/    # Individual user kins
        kinos.txt
        system.txt
        map.json
        thoughts.txt
        messages.json
        /modes/
        /adaptations/
        /memories/
        /sources/
        /images/
```

Each kin follows a standardized folder structure inherited from its blueprint template:

```
/kin_NAME/
  kinos.txt         # Explanation of how KinOS works
  system.txt        # Base system prompt for the kin
  map.json          # Index and purpose of each file
  thoughts.txt      # Internal reasoning of the AI
  messages.json     # Conversation history
  /modes/           # Different operational modes
    general.txt     # Default mode
    [custom].txt    # kin-specific modes
  /adaptations/     # Context-specific behaviors
    [context].txt   # Adaptation instructions
  /memories/        # Long-term storage
    [category]/     # Categorized memories
  /sources/         # Web-sourced information
    [source].txt    # External information
  /images/          # Visual content
    [image].jpg     # Stored images
```

#### 3.1 File Descriptions

##### 3.1.1 Core Files
- **kinos.txt**: Explains the KinOS system to the LLM
- **system.txt**: Contains the base system prompt for the kin
- **map.json**: JSON file describing each file's purpose and relationship
- **thoughts.txt**: Internal reasoning log of the AI, not directly shared with users
- **messages.json**: JSON array of message objects with user/assistant attribution

##### 3.1.2 Directories

- **adaptations/**: Contains instructions for adapting to specific contexts
- **memories/**: Stores important information for long-term reference
- **sources/**: Contains information gathered from external sources

### 5. Core Components Implementation

#### 5.1 Context Builder

The Context Builder selects relevant files to include in the LLM's context window:

1. **Context Analysis**: Processes the current conversation state
2. **Relevance Scoring**: Assigns relevance scores to kin files
3. **Context Window Construction**: Optimizes token usage while maintaining relevance
4. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjusts selection based on conversation flow

Implementation:
```python
def build_context(kin_id, current_message):
    # Load kin structure
    kin = load_kin(kin_id)
    
    # Always include these files
    core_files = [
        "kinos.txt",
        "system.txt",
        "map.json"
    ]
    
    # Get recent messages (limiting to conserve tokens)
    recent_messages = get_recent_messages(kin_id, limit=10)
    
    # Generate a context selection prompt
    selection_prompt = f"""
    Based on the current conversation:
    {format_messages(recent_messages)}
    
    And the new message:
    {current_message}
    
    Which kin files would be most relevant to include in the context?
    Available files: {list_kin_files(kin_id)}
    
    Return a JSON array of file paths, sorted by relevance.
    """
    
    # LLM call to determine relevant files
    relevant_files = llm_select_files(selection_prompt)
    
    # Combine and optimize context
    context = build_optimized_context(core_files, relevant_files, recent_messages)
    
    return context
```

#### 5.2 Context Updater

The Context Updater modifies kin files based on the conversation:

1. **Update Detection**: Identifies which files need to be updated
2. **Content Generation**: Generates new file content
3. **Consistency Check**: Ensures updates maintain kin consistency
4. **File System Integration**: Writes updates to the file system

Implementation:
```python
def update_kin_files(kin_id, llm_response):
    # Extract file update instructions from LLM response
    file_updates = parse_update_instructions(llm_response)
    
    # Update messages.json with new response
    append_message(kin_id, "assistant", llm_response.message)
    
    # Update thoughts.txt with reasoning
    append_thoughts(kin_id, llm_response.reasoning)
    
    # Process each file update
    for update in file_updates:
        path = update["path"]
        content = update["content"]
        operation = update["operation"]  # create, update, delete
        
        if operation == "create":
            create_file(kin_id, path, content)
        elif operation == "update":
            update_file(kin_id, path, content)
        elif operation == "delete":
            delete_file(kin_id, path)
    
    # Update map.json if files were added or removed
    if any(u["operation"] in ["create", "delete"] for u in file_updates):
        update_map(kin_id)
```

#### 5.3 Response Generator

The Response Generator processes the context and generates responses:

1. **Context Processing**: Analyzes the constructed context
2. **Response Generation**: Generates user-facing response
3. **File Update Planning**: Determines necessary file updates
4. **Mode Selection**: Suggests mode changes if needed

Implementation:
```python
def generate_response(kin_id, context, message):
    # Create Aider instance
    aider_instance = aider.Aider()
    
    # Configure Aider with kin-specific settings
    configure_aider(aider_instance, kin_id)
    
    # Process with Aider
    aider_response = aider_instance.process(context, message)
    
    # Parse response and extract components
    response = {
        "message": extract_user_message(aider_response),
        "reasoning": extract_reasoning(aider_response),
        "file_updates": extract_file_updates(aider_response),
        "mode_suggestion": extract_mode_suggestion(aider_response)
    }
    
    return response
```
